            <p>A product description is the marketing copy that explains what a product is and why it’s worth purchasing.<br>
                 The purpose of a product description is to supply customers with important information about the features <br>
                 and benefits of the product so they’re compelled to buy.<br>

                However, entrepreneurs and marketers, even professional copywriters,<br>
                 alike are susceptible to a common mistake that comes up when writing product descriptions:<br>
                  writing product descriptions that simply describe your products,<br>
                   as a supplement to product photography.<br>
                   Why is it wrong?<br>
                    Because great product descriptions need to augment<br>
                     your product pages by selling your products to real people,<br>
                 not just acting as back-of-the-box dispensers<br>
                  of information for search engines<br>
                  (though search engine optimization can't be an afterthought, of course).<br>
                
                Let’s have a look at nine simple ways to persuade<br>
                 visitors to your online store with product descriptions that sell.</p>
